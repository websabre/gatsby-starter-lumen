## How do you define happiness?
So, what makes you happy? Is it your work, your car, house, money or is it being with family and friends.

There is no particular definition of happiness if I ask you. Maybe you can find joy in every one of the things I mentioned above, but is it right, or you been deceiving yourself by thinking that it's true?

Sometimes, it's simple joys that make you happy. In the end, we are nothing but memories of what we did.

No one can create or establish a framework to be happy because every one of us has different mindsets, situations to deal with, and living with different people around us. Happiness is always elusive like beauty and love; Human brains aren't wired that way.

The only way we can say we are happy is when we have a moment of ecstasy.    

Happiness is determined more by the state of one's mind than by one's external conditions, circumstances, or eventsâ€”at least once one's basic survival needs are met and that anyone can achieve happiness through the systematic training of our hearts and minds

Yet in today's world, we ironically sacrifice happiness for success only to lower our brain's success rates.

Here are some aspects of when we can be happy

+ To me, happiness is derived from the smallest and most significant moments of life that can't be replaced with anything in the world.

+ A little smile that automatically flashes on our face when we see the gift our beloved one has sent for us is happiness

+ The immense surprised feeling when someone plans a surprise birthday party for us is happiness

+ Happiness is so much about tiny moments of life that we often don't even notice.

+ Happiness is all about people. About those whom we love & about those who love us.

+ When we are around such people, we find more happiness and peace in life.

+ So don't ever leave your loved ones no matter what! And always consider them & give attention to them. Make them feel special because that's how happiness spreads. And forever live your tiniest moments of life to the fullest.

+ Because unhappiness can make us hopeless in our lives, a person who is always sad and lost in his thoughts can't be expected to live a vibrant, healthy & prosperous life.

+ Such a person is always a failure both in his professional and personal life. Therefore one should always find ways to be happy in life
